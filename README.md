### vim-lispy

A plugin for interacting with lisp languages primarily clojure, clojurescript & pixie

There are some features that I use frequently in conjunction with this plugin available in vim-sane
specifically these are moving the cursor around in insert mode with C-f/b

Also vim-surround comes in handy with `yssb`
